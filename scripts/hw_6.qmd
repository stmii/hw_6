```{r}
# add libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(rio)
library(here)

# import star data
star <- import(here("data/star.csv"))
#head(star)
```

We used the following packages for this assignment: tidyverse [@tidyverse],
Rio by @rio,
  and here [@here].

We also reviewed the website for the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center [@NSC_PersistenceRetention] as it provides information on persistence and retention.
